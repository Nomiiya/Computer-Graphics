* Does this cat satisfy the requirements?
* Is the movement good ( Is that simple circle movement satisfactory? And the joint movement)
* Is this plane good enough?

* Do we have to use an image for the texture?
* Go to office hours for phong illumination

Notes:
   Solved? 
	* Can't rotate the tail
	* Can't rotate the head
   To move the tail (subtract from y && rotate y) --> same with the head
